# Web PKI Angular 2+ samples

This is an [Angular](https://angular.io/) 5 project showing the usage of the [`web-pki` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-pki)
on TypeScript to use the [Web PKI component](https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/articles/web-pki/).

**This is NOT an AngularJS project** (formerly known as "Angular 1.x").

## Running the project

To run the project, open a command prompt on the project's root folder and follow the steps below:

1. `npm install`
1. `ng serve --open`

This will automatically open a web browser on http://localhost:4200/ displaying the running project.

## Visual Studio files (.sln and .csproj)

The files `web-pki-angular-samples.sln` and `web-pki-angular-samples.csproj` are merely to open the Angular project
on Visual Studio for editing. **They are not needed** to run or edit the project, you can safely ignore them.
