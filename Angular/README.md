# Web PKI TypeScript/Angular 2+ samples

This is an [Angular](https://angular.io/) 5 project showing the usage of the npm package [web-pki](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-pki)
on TypeScript to use the [Web PKI component](https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/articles/web-pki/).

**This is NOT an AngularJS project** (also known as "Angular 1.x").

## Running the project

To run the project, you must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. To check, run:

```sh
npm --version
```

> If you don't have npm installed, [click here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

You must also have the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) installed. To check:

```sh
ng --version
```

> If you don't have the Angular CLI, install it by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Then, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository or [download](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/WebPkiSamples/archive/master.zip) and extract it
1. Open a command prompt on the folder `Angular` and run:
1. `npm install`
1. `ng serve --open`

This will automatically open a web browser on http://localhost:4200/ displaying the running project.

## IDE-specific files (`.sln` and `.csproj`)

The files `web-pki-angular.sln` and `web-pki-angular.csproj` are merely to open the project
on Visual Studio for editing. **They are not needed** to run or edit the project, you can safely ignore them.
